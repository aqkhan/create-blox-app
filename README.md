# Create Blox App internal repo

## Basic todo
- Start with this cli which essentially is the `npx create-blox-app`
- You can use the boilerplate as is with little POCs
- The idea is that this cli creates a folder
- Writes a .env file which has all the values based on the user input
- Creates a package.json file according to the user input
